# Node blog
This app uses node.js, mongoDB and mongoose to create an interface where you can add a blog and the data is added to the mongoDB atlass database. Then the frontend fetches data from the database and displays it. You can also delete a blog and its data will be erased from the mongoDB database too.

### Run the app
The app will open in localhost:7000
